	<h1>Welcome to Slingstanbol</h1>
	<p>Sling-Stanbol integrates Apache Sling and Apache Stanbol. It provides features to access Stanbol functionality to enhance
	and process Sling content.</p>
	<h2>Stanbol</h2>
	<p>All <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/stanbol/">Stanbol</a> services are available in the OSGi environment and can be 
	accessed by Sling components. The unaltered Stanbol webinterface is available at <a href="/stanbol/">/stanbol/</a>, it 
	should provide all functionality as in the Stanbol full launcher, post a bug if something is missing.</p>
	<h2>Sling</h2>
	<p>Sling-Stanbol is a <a href="http://sling.apache.org">Sling</a> launcher extending the default Sling Launcher with 
	bundles to integrate the Stanbol features. It also includes support for JAX-RS resources and includes the Clerezza 
	JAX-RS Utilities for RDF.</p>
	<h2>Sling-Stanbol</h2>
	<p>Sling-Stanbol provides a Resource-Page that can be used enhance HTML resources with RDFa annotations. Thanks to
	the Stanbol suggestions annotating documents becomes easy.</p>
	<p>You may upload HTML documents via WebDav or check it out with one of the example documents:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/slingstanbol/howl.html.stanbol">/slingstanbol/howl.html.stanbol</a></li>
		<li><a href="/slingstanbol/turkey.html.stanbol">/slingstanbol/turkey.html.stanbol</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>On the resource-page you an also see pre-computed meta-data, this is generated whenever a document is added
	or modified. It can be accessed by adding ".rdf" to the end of the URI (webinterface).</p>
	<p>The precomputed metdata is stored in a graph than can also be accessed from Stanbol, for instance you can use the Stanbol Sparql endpoint to query it. 
	You can, for example, use the form at <a href="/stanbol/sparql">/stanbol/sparql</a> and the following query to get all triples from the enhancement graph:</p>
	<pre class="code">
	SELECT *
	WHERE {
	    GRAPH &lt;urn:x-localinstance:/enhancement.graph> {?s ?p ?o}
	}
	</pre>
